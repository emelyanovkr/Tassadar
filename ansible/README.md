# playbooks/pxc.yml

This playbook installs and configures a three-node Percona XtraDB Cluster. It
expects the inventory group `pxc` to contain exactly `pxc-1`, `pxc-2`, and
`pxc-3`.

The playbook consists of two plays and three roles:

1. `Prepare Percona nodes` runs the `pxc` role on all PXC nodes.
2. `Configure PXC cluster` runs the `pxc_cluster` orchestration role, which
   calls the shared `pxc_verify` role after joining the nodes.

## Role `pxc`

The preparation role performs the same installation and configuration steps on
all three nodes:

- validates Ubuntu, the inventory host names, and the generated root password;
- waits until `cloud-init` has finished;
- installs the packages required by the official Percona apt repository;
- installs `percona-release` and enables the `pxc80` repository;
- waits for the dedicated data device at `/dev/disk/by-id/virtio-data`;
- formats the device as `ext4` only when it does not already contain a
  filesystem;
- persists the stable `/dev/disk/by-id/virtio-data` mount in `/etc/fstab`;
- preserves existing mount-point ownership during recovery;
- preseeds the MySQL root password for non-interactive package installation;
- installs the `percona-xtradb-cluster` package directly onto the mounted data
  disk without automatically starting MySQL;
- ensures the mounted MySQL data directory belongs to `mysql` after installation;
- calculates `server_id` from the inventory name (`pxc-1` becomes `1`);
- renders `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` from
  `roles/pxc/templates/pxc.cnf.j2`.

The disk is mounted before the Percona package is installed, so MySQL creates
its data directory on the dedicated disk from the beginning. There is no
datadir migration or copy step. A disk with an unexpected filesystem causes
the role to fail instead of formatting it.

The rendered configuration contains the Galera provider, cluster name and
address, node name and private address, strict mode, SST method, and the MySQL
settings required by PXC. `wsrep_cluster_address` is built automatically from
the private `ansible_host` values of every host in the `pxc` group.

## Role `pxc_cluster`

The cluster role orchestrates the nodes in a strict order:

1. Starts `mysql@bootstrap.service` only on `pxc-1`.
2. Waits until `pxc-1` reports a one-node `Primary` cluster in the `Synced`
   state with `wsrep_connected=ON` and `wsrep_ready=ON`.
3. Reads the default PXC TLS files from `pxc-1` and copies them to each joining
   node.
4. Starts regular `mysql` on `pxc-2` and verifies a healthy two-node cluster.
5. Starts regular `mysql` on `pxc-3` and verifies a healthy three-node
   cluster.
6. Checks wsrep health on every node.
7. Verifies replication with a database, table, and row written across
   different nodes.

The orchestration tasks use `run_once` with `delegate_to`. Ansible still opens
each SSH connection from the local control machine through the bastion; the PXC
nodes do not connect to each other over SSH.

## Variables

Cluster variables are defined in `group_vars/pxc.yml`:

- `pxc_repo` selects the Percona repository (`pxc80` by default);
- `pxc_cluster_name` sets the wsrep cluster name;
- `pxc_provider` points to the Galera provider library;
- `pxc_sst_method` selects the state snapshot transfer method;
- `pxc_mysql_datadir` points to the MySQL data directory;
- `pxc_data_device` and `pxc_data_filesystem` control the dedicated
  data-disk mount;
- `pxc_tls_files` and `pxc_tls_private_files` describe the TLS files copied
  from the bootstrap node;
- `pxc_cluster_address` is generated from all PXC private IP addresses;
- `pxc_root_password` is generated once in `.generated/pxc_root_password`.

To provide a fixed root password, define `pxc_root_password_override` in
Ansible variables. Do not commit the password to the repository.

## Tags

- `install` runs package installation and configuration;
- `cluster` runs bootstrap and sequential node joins;
- `verify` runs wsrep health and replication checks.

The initial deployment should use the complete playbook. The `install` tag
prepares storage and leaves MySQL stopped, `cluster` expects prepared nodes,
and `verify` expects an already running three-node cluster.

## Recover one PXC node

Use the dedicated recovery playbook only when exactly one PXC node is down and
the other two nodes form a healthy two-node Primary component:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pxc-recover-node.yml \
  -e pxc_recovery_node=pxc-3 \
  -e pxc_recovery_allow_sst=true
```

Optionally select either healthy survivor as the TLS source:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pxc-recover-node.yml \
  -e pxc_recovery_node=pxc-3 \
  -e pxc_recovery_donor=pxc-2 \
  -e pxc_recovery_allow_sst=true
```

The explicit SST acknowledgement is required because a joining node may need
a full State Snapshot Transfer, which replaces its local MySQL data. The role
uses IST automatically when Galera can obtain all missing writes from a
survivor's cache.

The recovery node must already be reachable over SSH. If the Droplet itself is
lost, use OpenTofu first to replace that Droplet, reattach its data volume, and
regenerate `inventory.ini`. Do not use this playbook for a full-cluster outage;
that procedure must select a safe bootstrap node from Galera recovery state.

For example, inspect the replacement plan before applying it:

```bash
cd ../tofu
tofu plan -replace='digitalocean_droplet.pxc["pxc-3"]'
tofu apply -replace='digitalocean_droplet.pxc["pxc-3"]'
```

The plan must replace the selected Droplet and its attachment without replacing
the corresponding `digitalocean_volume.pxc_data` resource. After apply,
return to `ansible/` and run the recovery playbook with the same node name.

Project-level run commands, connectivity checks, and basic MySQL commands are
documented in the root `README.md`.

## Recovery verification

Recovery checks TCP port 4567 on both survivors from the target node before
preparing it, and runs the shared `pxc_verify` health and write/read checks after
joining. The TCP check does not cover reverse traffic, UDP, or the SST/IST ports;
those transfers are validated by the real synchronization step. Shared
verification resets only the dedicated `percona.example` test table.

## Test a node outage and recovery

On an already installed, healthy, dedicated test cluster, run from `ansible/`:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pxc-test-recovery.yml \
  -e pxc_recovery_node=pxc-3 \
  -e pxc_test_allow_node_stop=true \
  -e pxc_recovery_allow_sst=true
```

This test deliberately stops MySQL on the selected node. It requires explicit
acknowledgement before any database writes or service changes. It:

1. verifies the original three-node cluster;
2. writes a unique baseline record from the selected node and verifies it on
   both survivors;
3. stops both possible MySQL services on that node;
4. waits for a healthy two-node component, writes one record on each survivor,
   and verifies both writes while the selected node is still down;
5. invokes the production recovery role's preflight and orchestration;
6. verifies the baseline and outage records on every node, including the
   recovered node.

The test uses `percona.recovery_probe`, separate from `percona.example`, so
recovery's ordinary replication check cannot erase the outage evidence. Records
are isolated by a random run ID. Final verification attempts to delete only
that run's records, including when the final read check fails. Earlier failures
can leave those test records in place for diagnosis.

An `always` block attempts recovery even if the outage write/read check fails.
If recovery itself fails its safety or connectivity checks, fix that problem
and run `pxc-recover-node.yml` manually; the test cannot guarantee restoration
through a network failure. Do not interrupt the test while the node is down.
Run one such test at a time.

The test reuses the production recovery role on an already prepared node; it
does not exercise the recovery playbook's package installation or disk mount
step. It simulates MySQL unavailability with a controlled service stop, not a
hard crash, network partition, or Droplet loss. It does not force IST or SST;
coverage of both transfer paths requires separate real-cluster runs.

## Automation

Deployment and recovery automatically run the shared `pxc_verify` health and
replication checks. No separate local test command is required.

CI/CD can run the same deployment and recovery playbooks. The outage scenario
in `pxc-test-recovery.yml` is a separate, explicitly enabled test for a dedicated
test cluster; it deliberately stops MySQL and should not run on every deployment.

There is no local simulated regression suite. Negative cases such as missing
replica rows, Non-Primary status, and unreachable Galera ports are enforced by
the Ansible tasks but are not covered by separate automated regression tests.
